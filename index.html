    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is Alex, and I'm studying at Weber state university for comptuer science. I went to Layton High, and 
    Davis Tech to study networking. At Layton High I was president of the debate team and founder and president of
    Pilosophy club. This website has all the webpages I worked on as part of my CS 1030 class.
