        <p>My name is Alex, and I'm studying at Weber state university for comptuer science. I went to Layton High, and 
        Davis Tech to study networking. At Layton High I was president of the debate team and founder and president of
        Pilosophy club. This website has all the webpages I worked on as part of my CS 1030 class.
