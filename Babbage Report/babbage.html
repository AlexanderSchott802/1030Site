    <h1>Charles Babbage (1791 - 1871)</h1>
    <p>Charles Babbage was a professor of math at Cambridge University. 
        He became obsessed with the idea that if calculations were done 
        mechanically they could be done with much less error. After making 
        a small mechanical calculator in 1822 he started work on the 
        difference engine. This was a more advanced mechanical calculator, 
        and was discontinued in 1833 before it could finish production due
         to budgeting limitations.</p>

    <p>Next Babbage started working on the analytical engine. It was very 
        intricately designed, and had a system for a punch card input and 
        a processor that would print the result. This is the very same computer 
        process that defines most modern computers today, input, storage, 
        processing, and output. Again because of funding issues this was discontinued.</p>
    
    <p>As a consequence of creating the machine, he also indirectly helped create the 
        first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace. Ada wrote programs for the analytical 
        engine before it was completed. Much later on in 1984, long after Babbage died, 
        the analytical engine was built with the schematics left behind, and it worked 
        flawlessly. The success is a testament to the genius of Charles Babbage, a mind 
        truely ahead of its time.
