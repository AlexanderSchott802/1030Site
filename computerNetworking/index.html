    <h1>Computer Networking Cost Estimate:</h1>

    <p>The business will have very different needs based on what the business would be doing. 
        I'll assume an average apporach, meaning that they won't be using just one wifi router
        , but they also won't need advanced security or a proxy server. Firstly they'll need a 
        router. This will connect them to the internet using the second thing they need, access
         to an ISP. Access to the internet will cost about 150 a month depending on the need, and
          a router will cost about 250 up front. I chose a router with medium speed with a focus 
          on affordability. Next you'll need a switch to allow computers to connect on an internal
           nextwork. A switch costs around 150. You'll also need cable to connect all the components.
            150 dollars worth of Cat6 ethernet cable will be more than enough to connect everything.
             In total it will cost about 550 up front and 150 a month for every month afterward.
